<li><a name="blowfish"></a><h4>What is Blowfish encryption?</h4>
Blowfish is a strong encryption method that is widely accepted and used in commercial encryption products.
 The Blowfish encryption in DeadboltEdit is compatible with the OpenSSL implemention.  A good explanation of the Blowfish cipher can be found here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_%28cipher%29">Wikipedia: Blowfish Cipher</a>.

<!-- Yes, DeadboltEdit may be used for any purpose: personal, commercial, educational, etc. -->
<li><a name="commercial_use"></a><h4>Can DeadboltEdit be used for commercial purposes?</h4>
Yes. DeadboltEdit is free for everybody to use, and you may use it for any purpose you like,
 including commercial, government, public administration and educational use.
  For further details see the license information included with DeadboltEdit,
  or here: <a href="LicenseV3.html" target="_blank">License Information</a>.

<li><a name="autosave"></a><h4>Does the Mac OS X version of DeadboltEdit support Autosave?</h4>
No. There are no plans to implement Autosave.

<li><a name="filenames"></a><h4>How are DeadboltEdit files named?</h4>
Encrypted files are named with the file suffix <code>".ctxt"</code>, which identifies the file as a crypto-text file.<br><br>
Plain-text files (<font size=-1><i>"File -> Save Plain Text File &hellip;"</i></font>) are
 named with the usual <code>".txt"</code> file suffix, which should be usable with any text editor.
<br>
<br>
<a href="#top">Top</a>
</li>

<li><a name="formatted_text"></a><h4>Can I use graphics or special characters in my DeadboltEdit notes?</h4>
The editor is for plain-text only, like Windows Notepad &trade;. Special characters,
 such as "&pound; and &copy;" are supported, but graphic elements are not.
<br>
<br>
<a href="#top">Top</a>
</li>

<li><a name="openssl"></a><h4>How is the encryption compatible with OpenSSL?</h4>
When DeadboltEdit encrypts text, the actual encryption and encoding are compatible with OpenSSL encryption.
 This is an important consideration because the encryption implementation is verifiable against a respected
  implementation.<br><br>
The file format used by DeadboltEdit differs from the OpenSSL format because DeadboltEdit has additional
 information embedded in a file header to allow checking for file corruption. For this reason, you can't
  use DeadboltEdit files with OpenSSL.<br><br>
It is possible to remove file header information from a DeadboltEdit encrypted file, and then decrypt it
 with OpenSSL command-line tools using the same password that was used to encrypt it.  There will be an
 article on the website Support page that will explain how to do this.  This is not something you would
 want to do in actual practice, but it is a valuable excercise to demonstrate the correctness of the
 encryption implementation.

<li><a name="external_storage"></a><h4>Can DeadboltEdit be used with USB flash drives or cloud storage?</h4>
Yes, DeadboltEdit can save and open files on external drives, such as flash drives and cloud
 storage (ex. Google Drive&trade;).  This is accomplished by using the normal
 File Open (<font size=-1><i>"File -> Open &hellip;"</i></font>)
 and File Save (<font size=-1><i>"File -> Save"</i></font>) dialogs, and navigating to the desired
 external drive.<br><br>
 Note: The external drive must be connected and available to the computer prior to using
 with DeadboltEdit.
